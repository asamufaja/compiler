Semantics, doing some looking for errors with:
variables undeclared, types, doubly declared
out of place items like not-writeable expressions (ex: true = false)

symbol table will keep a variables identifier, type, size, offset
for scope, will have a nested symbol table situation
things that make new scope are methods, while, if/else, cases?, classes?
How about each class has a symbol table, keep list of those. When hit new scope, 
put that blockâ€™s symbol table on stack (if statement, function, yeah) 
each symbol table be a hash like symtable[name]->entry 
then can ask is x variable in this symbol table, and go down the stack finding the variable

class SymbolTableVisitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.symtableList = []
        self.currentExpr = None
        self.currentExprLeft = None
        self.currentClass = None
    def visit(self, n:Node):
        if isinstance(n, Expr):
            self.currentExpr = n
            # this is for knowing which expression I may be in, for type checking
        if isinstance(n, Decl):  # I think type is my node for variables
            if n.type == class:
                self.currentClass = n
            else:
                self.symtableList.append({n.name : [n.type, n.calcSize(), 0]})
                # also need to check if this var has been in a decl before

            # For now I will put calcSize() in the Type node, 
            # it will go through and calculate size if it's a class or method
            # The offset is 0 because that isn't given until code gen
        if isinstance(n, Type):
            # look up this variable in symbol table, it needs to have been decl'ed previously
            # also checking if it's type is the same, and type stuff like
            if self.currentExprLeft != None:
                # this must be the right one, make sure it works with the left and the expr.
            else:
                self.currentExprLeft = n
        node.next.accept(this)  # I'll have to put a next in all nodes that visits tree I think pre-order

I think the above is roughly what I need to do to cover undeclared, duplicate, and wrong type variables.

for function call argument writing, 
another visitor would look at function call nodes, and check if the types are the same

for assignment operators, a visitor would look at the left hand side and make sure it is either
    an ident, the example f().a, maybe others?
    I think the f().a example is where f() is returning an object? and the object has an a
I think it is easier to look at what can be on the left hand side than what can't. 
for doing correct things on right hand side,
    have literals, idents, ummmmm

Also maybe in one of these current visitors, like the symbol table one, check
if isinstance(n, Stmnt):
    if n.type == break:
        raise Exception("break in wrong place")

So the main function calling these visitors will try each one and catch exceptions
to have a moderately rough landing without exploding completely
