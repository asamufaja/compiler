Syntax Analysis Design (the parser)

TODO: add what I need to do to grammar to make it work (* and ? issues)
	write small example of a node and visitor skeleton code
		nodes don't have traversal logic BTW

basic grammar to deal with *
thing : repeatingthing PERIOD
repeatingthing : repeatingthing THING
		   | empty

basic grammar to deal with ?
thing : optthing PERIOD
optthing : THING
	   | empty

Making an empty production to be used in any of these situations is simple in SLY.

For object-oriented AST nodes...
4 classes: expression
	   statement
	   declaration
	   type

class expression
	Op_type enum, left, right, value, char, string, type, args
class statement
	Statement_type, exp, substatement, case_list for switch, 
class declaration
	ret_type:type, params: param_list, modifier:(public, private, none), ident:string, init:exp, body:statements[], (maybe put in classdecl:classdecl[] for making compilationunit a decl)
class type
	type_types:enum {
		Void, int, char, bool, string, class, method
	}
	Name:str, array:bool, subtype: type, param_list: decl

NOTE: might want more classes split out

The AST
Will have a declaration at the top of the tree for the CompilationUnit
Will have more declarations and some types to go with statements and expressions
Most of the meat of the tree is expressions
